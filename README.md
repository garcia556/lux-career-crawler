# Luxoft Careers crawler

While waiting for a new position in Luxoft I got too bored monitoring different filters manually using web page so I kind of automated it

### Prerequisites

- bash
- docker
- \*NIX-like OS (tested successfully on macOS and Ubuntu Server)

### Usage

```sh
./run.sh
```

### Defining own filters

By default script uses `url.db` file to lookup for filters

```sh
./run.sh
```
